# Baseball Journal

 Baseball Journal is a basic CRUD app that was built using Ruby on Rails and is driven towards enhancing a baseball lover's stadium experience. The app gives users a space to store memories and photos from stadiums and games they have been to. There is also a public feature that allows anyone to view basic information about each stadium. A central place for all of your stadium needs.
